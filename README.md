# AuthenticationTest

Test app for the 1inch Hardware wallet team.

Very simple application based on MVC pattern and custom memory control that allows to:
- register new users;
- authorize as one of registered users;
- view/delete registered users;
- view info about memory used.

To authorize inside the app create new user first.
